  system_prompt: >
    You are an expert in entity and relationship extraction.  
    Given a text and a list of target entity types, extract structured information
    about the entities, their descriptions, relationships, and overarching themes.


  prompt_template: |
    ---Goal---
    Given a pair of text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a
    list of entity types, identify all relationships among the identified entities.  
    Use **{language}** as the output language.
    The output should be a list of relationships between entities, with each relationship

    ---Steps---
    1. Using only the tuples provided in the **Source** and **Target** blocks, examine every
      possible source-entity ↔ target-entity pair and decide whether a direct,
      meaningful relationship exists in the context given.  
      **→ Always place the entity from the *Source* list first and the entity from the *Target* list second in every relationship you output.**  
      **→ Do NOT create any relationship between two Source entities or between two Target entities.  Only Source-to-Target pairs are allowed.**

    2. For each related pair, output one record in the format  
      ("relationship"<tuple_delimiter><source_entity_name><tuple_delimiter>
        <target_entity_name><tuple_delimiter><relationship_description>
        <tuple_delimiter><relationship_keywords><tuple_delimiter>
        <relationship_strength>)
      · **relationship_description**: 1 concise sentence.  
      · **relationship_keywords**: 3–5 comma-separated high-level tags.  
      · **relationship_strength**: integer 1–10 (10 = very strong).

    3. Return **all** relationship records as a single list, joined with
      **{record_delimiter}**.  
      Finish the entire output with **{completion_delimiter}**.
