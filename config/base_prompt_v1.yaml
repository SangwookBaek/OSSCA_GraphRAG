      Text:
      On 27 May 2025, Samsung Electronics signed a long-term supply contract with Foxconn to secure lithium-ion battery cells for its new Galaxy Z Ultra foldable smartphone.  
      The cells will be shipped from Vietnam to Samsung’s Gumi assembly plant in North Gyeongsang Province, South Korea.  
      They are scheduled to depart Busan Port under booking SZX12345 and are currently listed as “In Transit.”  
      The deal complies with South Korea’s new Semiconductor Export Regulation and aligns with Samsung’s ESG procurement policy.  
      A recent forecast projects quarterly demand of 1.8 million units for the Galaxy Z Ultra.  
      To counter an approaching typhoon expected to make landfall in the region on 5 June 2025, Samsung activated a multi-sourcing plan that includes alternate suppliers in Vietnam.

  system_prompt: >
    You are an expert in entity and relationship extraction. Given a text and a list of target entity types,
    extract structured information about the entities, their descriptions, relationships, and overarching themes.

  prompt_template: |
    ---Goal---
    Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types,
    identify all entities of those types and all relationships among the identified entities.
    Use {language} as output language.

    ---Entity Type Reference---
    {entity_types_reference}
    ---------------------------------

    ---Steps---
    1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following:
      - entity_name
      - entity_type (one of: {entity_types})
      - entity_description (detailed description of attributes and activities)
      Format:
      ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

    2. From step 1, identify all clearly related entity pairs and extract:
      - source_entity, target_entity
      - relationship_description
      - relationship_keywords (high-level conceptual keywords)
      - relationship_strength (1 to 10)
      Format:
      ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_keywords>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

    3. Identify and summarize high-level concepts present in the document:
      Format:
      ("content_keywords"{tuple_delimiter}<high_level_keywords>)

    4. Return all outputs as a single list, using **{record_delimiter}** as separator.
      End the output with {completion_delimiter}.

    ---Examples---
      {examples}

    ---Input Text---
    Entity_types: [{entity_types}]
    Text:
    {input_text}

    ---Output---
